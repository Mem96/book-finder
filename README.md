# Look4Books

Look4Books is a project I created for my learning journey on [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).

The purpose is to make it easy to access to multiple book titles on a chosen subject of interest.
In order to do so, an API was used. The external service used here is [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).

**You can try this project on [GitHub Pages]() or [Netfly]().**

The aim of this project is to encourage people to read more, even using the vastity of services available on the web.

I think one of the reasons why some people don't read is that they force themselves to approach books they don't like just because they are classicals.
This tool might help to find the books they really like, instead.

## How to use

This project is as easy as it gets to use. You simply have to type in the search bar whichever subject you'd like to look up, and a list of books will appear.

Information included is:

* Title
* Author(s)
* Book cover (when available)

You can also click on the *Read description* button to have an insight on the topics covered in the book.

### Why is something a bit weird?

Some descriptions might appear a bit weird, or authors' names could be sort of duplicated. 
This does not depend on Look4Books, but on the external service used and the material they provide.

I will try to fix this on the future.

## About the code

In this code you can see my first approach to fetching data and API in general.

If you have any suggestion, please feel free to copy the code and push your changes.
Same goes for the description mishaps. 

The code includes some comments on what I was doing in the specific section, in order to make it easier to follow.

In general, I think I might have divided the whole code in a couple of scripts, but since I realized that only at the end, I decided that the possible advantage in terms of order wasn't worth the effort.
